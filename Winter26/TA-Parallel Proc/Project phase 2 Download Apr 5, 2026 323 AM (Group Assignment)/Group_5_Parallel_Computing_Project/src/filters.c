/*
  Grayscale filter implementation (RGB to Grayscale)

  The grayscale filter converts a color image to grayscale by applying a weighted average of the red, green, and blue channels. 
  The weights are based on the perceived brightness of each color: 
  - Red contributes 29.9% (0.299) to the final intensity
  - Green contributes 58.7% (0.587) to the final intensity
  - Blue contributes 11.4% (0.114) to the final intensity

/*
  Gaussian blur filter implementation

  The Gaussian blur filter applies a convolution operation to the input image using a 3x3 kernel that approximates a Gaussian distribution. 
  The kernel is defined as follows:

    [1/16, 2/16, 1/16]
    [2/16, 4/16, 2/16]
    [1/16, 2/16, 1/16]

  Each pixel in the output image is computed by taking the weighted sum of the neighboring pixels in the input image, where the weights are determined by the kernel. 
  This results in a blurred version of the original image, which helps to reduce noise and detail.

/*  
  Sobel edge detection filter implementation

  The Sobel edge detection filter applies two separate convolution operations to the input image using two 3x3 kernels, Gx and Gy, which are designed to detect horizontal and vertical edges, respectively. 
  The kernels are defined as follows:

    Gx:
    [-1, 0, 1]
    [-2, 0, 2]
    [-1, 0, 1]

    Gy:
    [1, 2, 1]
    [0, 0, 0]
    [-1, -2, -1]

  Each pixel in the output image is computed by taking the magnitude of the gradient vector formed by the results of the two convolutions (Gx and Gy). 
  This results in an image that highlights the edges present in the original image.
