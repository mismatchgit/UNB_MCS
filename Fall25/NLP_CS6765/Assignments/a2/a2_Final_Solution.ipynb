        "3. Inspected misclassified documents to determine whether longer or shorter sentences were more prone to errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "From the analysis of the above three things I made the following observations:\n",
        "1. All models perform best on Class 0 and Class 1, while Class 2 is the hardest to classify and every model performs poorly on this class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Confusion matrices indicate that most of the confusion were between Class 1 and Class 2 across all models.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. From the common misclassified documents it can be seen that most common misclassified document's word counts were less than 100.\n",
        "\n",
        "So after overall analysis, the reason behind the varying performance of the models appears to be a combination of class difficulty, document length, and model characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class-specific difficulty:** Class 2 is consistently the hardest to classify, likely because it contains fewer distinctive keywords or more overlapping content with Class 1. This explains why all models perform worse on Class 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Document length effects**: Many common misclassified documents are short (less than 100 words), which provides less context for the models to make accurate predictions. Logistic Regression performs better on longer texts due to its ability to capture word interactions, whereas Naive Bayes relies mostly on individual word probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Model characteristics:\n",
        "   - Naive Bayes (Binary & Multinomial): Performs well for classes with strong keyword signals (Class 0 and Class 1) but struggles with nuanced context in Class 2 or short texts.\n",
        "   - Logistic Regression: Captures feature interactions better, giving it higher F1 for Class 0 and Class 1 in the dev set, but it is slightly less sensitive to small or imbalanced classes like Class 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the differences arise from the interplay between text length, class-specific ambiguity, and the models’ ability to leverage context versus word-level probabilities."

            "Index: 84, Words: 270, Text: Lufthansa Group provides incentives for the achievement of climate- related targets on board-level. The Supervisory Board defined specific CO2 reduction as focus topic for the strategic and sustainability target for long-term variable remuneration (LTI) for the 2020 financial year. The non-financial performance criteria thus take the interests of key stakeholders into account and provide long-term incentives for the environmental goal of reducing specific carbon emissions. For the LTI, the possible range of the target achievement for the financial and non- financial targets is between 0% and 200%. For the non-financial target “Environment”, the targets set by IATA (International Air Transport Association) for fuel efficiency are used, i.e. the average amount of kerosene consumed to carry a passenger 100 kilometres. The aim is to reduce specific fuel consumption by 1.5% p.a. and so to improve specific CO2 emissions. The LTI for 2020 includes emissions from Lufthansa’s own fleet as well as those from wet lease flights. To calculate performance, the improvement in specific CO2 emissions is measured annually over the four-year performance period. This was the Further Disclosure only non-financial target for LTI in 2019 and 2020 and accounted for 25% of the LTI. Specific CO2 efficiency (including wet-lease flights) came to 10.52 kg/100 passenger-kilometres in 2020 (2019: 9.22 kg/100 passenger-kilometres), so that performance in the 2020 financial year for the environmental parameter for the LTI 2020 was 0%. The development of this KPI in 2020 was due to the corona pandemic and mainly driven by comprehensive travel restrictions which resulted in lower passenger load factor and a higher share of short-haul flights which emit relatively more CO2 than long-haul flights.\n",
            "Index: 35, Words: 266, Text: Climate change is a long-term risk associated with high uncertainty regarding timing, scope and severity of potential impacts. The risks for insurers can be grouped into physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks relate to losses from climate trends (i.e. changing weather patterns and sea level rise) and climate events (i.e. extreme weather and natural disasters). These physical risks impact property & casualty (P&C) insurance, but also life insurance, for instance through higher than expected mortality rates. Losses can also follow from credit risk and collateral linked to the mortgage portfolio. Aegon is exposed to mortality risk and mortgage underwriting risks and has limited exposure to P&C risk, including catastrophic risk. Beyond insured losses from physical climate damages, climate change can increase uninsured damages and losses and may have disrupting and cascading effects on the wider economy and across the financial system. The second category of risks is associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks can affect the value of assets and impact the investments portfolios of insurers. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that Aegon itself is unable to adjust to environmental and sustainability goals. The transition risks are determined by largely uncertain factors such as policy and regulatory changes, political, social and market dynamics and technological innovations. Linked to both the physical and the transition risks, there could be litigation and reputational risks following from not fully considering or responding to the impacts of climate change, or not providing appropriate disclosure of current and future risks. The risks can relate both to Aegon and the companies in which it invests.\n",

The actions we have taken to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings have enabled us to currently exceed regulatory requirements and meet the expectations of our stakeholders. Over the past 20 years, the Bank has voluntarily adopted various measures to considerably improve the energy efficiency of its buildings. As a member of the Energy Savers Circle of Hydro-Quebec (a public utility that manages the transmission and distribution of electricity in Quebec), the Bank has set up an innovative web-based interface to remotely manage energy use at over 100 of its branches. This system allows the Bank to oversee its facilities and make sure they meet energy efficiency goals, year after year. The Bank also implements the criteria for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification in its buildings and aims for LEED v4 Gold certification for its new head office to be completed in 2023. Among other things, this allows the Bank to reduce its Greenhouse gas emissions despite an increase in activities. Our Greenhouse gas emissions for 2019 have been calculated at 9,732 tonnes of CO2-down 16% compared to 2017. The Bank has renewed its commitment to carbon neutrality by buying carbon credits to offset emissions that can't be eliminated. This year, the Bank has set a target to reduce its Greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2025. This science-based target aims to help limit global warming to 1.5 C, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.\n",
            "Index: 186, Words: 208, Text: The main impacts of the 4ºC scenario were: • Physical ramifications of climate change: in this scenario we expect extreme weather events of escalating severity and frequency, which could increase disruption to our assets and our customers. This would require investment to ‘harden’ assets and would heighten the safety risk to our field employees. Our approach to physical climate risk is discussed in more detail below. • Lower system visibility: as this scenario sees less coordinated policy and regulation in pursuit of decarbonisation, we would anticipate a greater variety of solutions being deployed across our networks. This could increase overall system costs and reduce visibility over the network, potentially slowing our responsiveness to disruptive events. We do note, however, that a greater number of distributed assets would increase the potential for local balancing, which could mitigate this. • Inequality of access: without carefully designed policy, we believe decarbonisation activities have the potential to leave some sectors of society behind: for example, heat pumps and the energy efficiency upgrades they typically require are currently cost-prohibitive for many. As well as the ethical implications of this, there is a risk to the Group, especially for our US businesses, that a proportion of our customers would struggle to pay their bills.\n",

The FTSE All World (ex controversial weapons) Climate Balanced Factor Index tilts away from Carbon Reserves and Carbon Emissions, whilst positively tilting towards Green Revenues. The tilts are set such that the inclusion of the climate-related tilts, introduces a relatively modest tracking error compared to the Balanced Factor index without climate tilts.

The Supervisory Board defined specific CO2 reduction as focus topic for the strategic and sustainability target for long-term variable remuneration (LTI) for the 2020 financial year. The non-financial performance criteria thus take the interests of key stakeholders into account and provide long-term incentives for the environmental goal of reducing specific carbon emissions. For the LTI, the possible range of the target achievement for the financial and non- financial targets is between 0% and 200%. For the non-financial target “Environment”, the targets set by IATA (International Air Transport Association) for fuel efficiency are used, i.e. the average amount of kerosene consumed to carry a passenger 100 kilometres. The aim is to reduce specific fuel consumption by 1.5% p.a. and so to improve specific CO2 emissions. The LTI for 2020 includes emissions from Lufthansa’s own fleet as well as those from wet lease flights. To calculate performance, the improvement in specific CO2 emissions is measured annually over the four-year performance period. This was the Further Disclosure only non-financial target for LTI in 2019 and 2020 and accounted for 25% of the LTI. Specific CO2 efficiency (including wet-lease flights) came to 10.52 kg/100 passenger-kilometres in 2020 (2019: 9.22 kg/100 passenger-kilometres), so that performance in the 2020 financial year for the environmental parameter for the LTI 2020 was 0%. The development of this KPI in 2020 was due to the corona pandemic and mainly driven by comprehensive travel restrictions which resulted in lower passenger load factor and a higher share of short-haul flights which emit relatively more CO2 than long-haul flights.\n",

The risks for insurers can be grouped into physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks relate to losses from climate trends (i.e. changing weather patterns and sea level rise) and climate events (i.e. extreme weather and natural disasters). These physical risks impact property & casualty (P&C) insurance, but also life insurance, for instance through higher than expected mortality rates. Losses can also follow from credit risk and collateral linked to the mortgage portfolio. Aegon is exposed to mortality risk and mortgage underwriting risks and has limited exposure to P&C risk, including catastrophic risk. Beyond insured losses from physical climate damages, climate change can increase uninsured damages and losses and may have disrupting and cascading effects on the wider economy and across the financial system. The second category of risks is associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks can affect the value of assets and impact the investments portfolios of insurers. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that Aegon itself is unable to adjust to environmental and sustainability goals. The transition risks are determined by largely uncertain factors such as policy and regulatory changes, political, social and market dynamics and technological innovations. Linked to both the physical and the transition risks, there could be litigation and reputational risks following from not fully considering or responding to the impacts of climate change, or not providing appropriate disclosure of current and future risks. The risks can relate both to Aegon and the companies in which it invests.\n",

This would require investment to ‘harden’ assets and would heighten the safety risk to our field employees. Our approach to physical climate risk is discussed in more detail below. • Lower system visibility: as this scenario sees less coordinated policy and regulation in pursuit of decarbonisation, we would anticipate a greater variety of solutions being deployed across our networks. This could increase overall system costs and reduce visibility over the network, potentially slowing our responsiveness to disruptive events. We do note, however, that a greater number of distributed assets would increase the potential for local balancing, which could mitigate this. • Inequality of access: without carefully designed policy, we believe decarbonisation activities have the potential to leave some sectors of society behind: for example, heat pumps and the energy efficiency upgrades they typically require are currently cost-prohibitive for many. As well as the ethical implications of this, there is a risk to the Group, especially for our US businesses, that a proportion of our customers would struggle to pay their bills.\n",

The FTSE All World (ex controversial weapons) Climate Balanced Factor Index tilts away from Carbon Reserves and Carbon Emissions, whilst positively tilting towards Green Revenues. The tilts are set such that the inclusion of the climate-related tilts, introduces a relatively modest tracking error compared to the Balanced Factor index without climate tilts. This allowed the Trustee to conclude that the new index was consistent with its fiduciary duty and provided an element of climate change protection.\n",

In addition to an impact analysis using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report's RCP 2.6 scenario assuming a 2 C average temperature rise by 2050, we also conducted an impact analysis using the RCP 8.5 scenario assuming a 4 C average temperature rise by 2050, the worst-case scenario for global warming and physical risk. Under both the 2 C and 4 C scenarios, we estimated that our credit costs would increase by up to $52 billion by 2050.\n",

We’ve got to be more efficient and competitive year on year, delivering what our customers want and how they want it – not least because disrupters will enter the market and beat us if we don’t. I’m the Chair of Climatewise – the insurance industry’s body on climate change. The risks of unmitigated global warming are pretty stark, for individuals, for business and for communities. We need to do all we can to address this challenge. For insurers, a temperature increase of four degrees effectively means insurers will have to bow out. Insurers will not be able to cover the risks.

Strategic risks are related to competition, markets, customers, products and regulation. For example, unpredictable regulation and subsidies may distort raw material and final product markets, and costs of greenhouse gas emissions may influence UPM’s financial performance. However, transition to low-carbon economy should bring business opportunities to UPM’s renewable and recyclable products. Operational risks can be related to supply chain, availability and price of major inputs. Climate change may also cause operational or hazard risk related to exceptional weather events such as more severe storms, floods and draughts resulting in e.g. unpredictable wood harvesting conditions and hydro power availability. Climate change may also contribute to financial risks such as electricity price.\n",

Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond the Bank’s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, and infrastructure), model, insurance, liquidity, capital adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, reputational, environmental and social, and other risks. Examples of such risk factors include the economic, financial, and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; general business and economic conditions in the regions in which the Bank operates; geopolitical risk; the ability of the Bank to execute on long-term strategies and shorter-term key strategic priorities, including the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions, business retention plans, and strategic plans; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks or data security breaches) on the Bank’s information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; model risk; fraud to which the Bank is exposed; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to the Bank or its affiliates, including relating to the care and control of information, and other risks arising from the Bank’s use of third-party service providers; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations, including without limitation tax laws, capital guidelines and liquidity regulatory guidance and the Bank recapitalization “bail-in” regime; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big technology competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes and disruptive technology; environmental and social risk; exposure related to significant litigation and regulatory matters; ability of the Bank to attract, develop, and retain key talent; changes to the Bank’s credit ratings; changes in currency and interest rates (including the possibility of negative interest rates); increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition risk; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Bank; existing and potential international debt crises; environmental and social risk; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events.

For example, we generally include clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our partnership in case of improper or unethical conduct. In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of promotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners. We utilize a broad distribution strategy which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer business to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the company’s sales in 2020. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with suppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any potential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we enforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and environmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers’ premises. To reduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas works with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products, does not have a single-sourcing model.\n",

The latest trend is related to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure TCFD. In other words, the trend is evaluating the financial values of non-financial information. The relevant companies would need to follow this trend and disclose related information faithfully. As corporate citizens that follow the UN SDGs, companies must perceive their roles and promote the relevant matters with an active mindset. Governance should be improved as well. In particular, LG Chem must disclose information transparently and establish a clear stance. Since LG Chem is the best and leading chemical company in Korea, its stakeholders will ask for flawless corporate management. LG Chem should feel proud and responsible at the same time because the society has great expectations for the company to meet the highest level of ESG regarding the rights of shareholders, safety and health of workers, health and privacy of consumers, and fair trading.

Our stakeholders are those people or organizations who affect or are affected by our operations, including our employees, consumers, suppliers and their workers, customers, investors, media, governments, and NGOs. The adidas Stakeholder Relations Guideline specifies key principles for the development of stakeholder relations and details the different forms of stakeholder engagement. adidas participates in a variety of industry associations, multi-stakeholder organizations, and non-profit initiatives. Through these memberships, we work closely with leading companies from different sectors to develop sustainable business approaches and to debate social and environmental topics on a global and local level. We use collaborations and partnerships to build leverage for systemic change in our industry, such as for strengthening chemical management practices and raising standards in the cotton supply chain. In addition, we build awareness, capacity, and knowledge of laws and rights among factory management and workers by partnering with leading providers such as the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Better Factories Cambodia program, as well as with the United Nation’s International Organization for Migration with the objective to ensure that the labor rights of foreign and migrant workers are upheld in the adidas supply chain. ► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/PARTNERSHIPS https://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/managing-sustainability/partnership-approach/\n",

Through the programme, we impart awareness on the applications and benefits of using plastic, addressing common misconceptions and negative perception about this material. We also addressed the issue of waste management focusing on clean-up activities with the community at selected rivers and beach. This include regular workshops, talks and gotong-royong activities which impart the know-how on waste segregation at home and keeping the environment clean. These initiatives reached out to more than 2,700 participants and volunteers. ecoCare is PCG’s flagship environmental conservation initiative, run in collaboration with the Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) since 2005. Being the first environmental education centre in the East Cost of Peninsular Malaysia, it promotes awareness on the importance of mangrove ecosystems in protection of biodiversity as well as coastal terrain. Through ecoCare, we engage local community volunteers in carrying out conservation and rehabilitation activities. In 2019, more than 6,300 mangrove trees and seedlings were planted, while the ecoCare Environmental Education Centre (EEC) attracted more than 4,000 visitors.\n",

The tire industry has been dealing with and responding to issues like sustainable natural rubber and microplastics in the last few years. The sustainability issue of the natural rubber supply chain is associated with human rights, environmental protection, transparent management, productivity, quality, and quality of life. Hankook Tire & Technology is resolving this issue by operating a global platform called the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber GPSNR for the supply chain and automotive industry. Our company conducts research on microplastics for tire wear particles. Hankook Tire & Technology is not only required to manage the sustainable supply chain for natural rubber. The sustainable supply chain also applies to the raw materials supplied by LG Chem. As LG Chem is a major supplier of our company, the sustainability efforts of LG Chem will have a positive effect on our responsible sourcing policy and products. We look forward to seeing a true collaboration on sustainability among companies or among industries.\n",

Net cash generated from financing activities and net cash generated from continuing financing activities amounted to € 479 million each (2019: € 2.273 billion net cash used).

For example, we generally include clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our partnership in case of improper or unethical conduct. In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of promotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners. We utilize a broad distribution strategy which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer business to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the company’s sales in 2020. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with suppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any potential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we enforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and environmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers’ premises. To reduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas works with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products, does not have a single-sourcing model.\n",

As corporate citizens that follow the UN SDGs, companies must perceive their roles and promote the relevant matters with an active mindset. Governance should be improved as well. In particular, LG Chem must disclose information transparently and establish a clear stance. Since LG Chem is the best and leading chemical company in Korea, its stakeholders will ask for flawless corporate management. LG Chem should feel proud and responsible at the same time because the society has great expectations for the company to meet the highest level of ESG regarding the rights of shareholders, safety and health of workers, health and privacy of consumers, and fair trading.

Every year we make significant investments in real estate and net- work maintenance and upgrades to build resilience into our operational infrastructure. Based on the lessons learned during storms such as Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Matthew, and Hurricane Michael, we have taken steps to increase the resilience of our network in affected areas and other at-risk areas. Depending on the area and risk, these steps to enhance infrastructure resilience have included adding stilts to raise equipment that powers cell sites, moving site generators from basements to a higher level or platforms, and installing new fiber solutions underground rather than using aerial fiber. We also have ongoing efforts to improve backup facility power systems, including power capacity at facilities located in areas with greater storm and wildfire risk, by adding generators to at-risk sites where, historically, the site only had backup batteries.
