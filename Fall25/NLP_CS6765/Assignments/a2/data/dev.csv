598,We embrace our responsibility to understand and manage our own carbon footprint. Our approach is to limit and minimise our direct carbon impact and create awareness to encourage positive sustainable behaviour. We have achieved net-zero carbon emissions status in February 2020 within our global operations and committed to ongoing carbon neutrality in all our direct global operations. Over the short-term we are looking into sourcing our energy from renewable sources.,1
563,"In addition to its efforts to develop sustainable products and services, the Bank has identified opportunities to be greener in its operations. The actions we have taken to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings have enabled us to currently exceed regulatory requirements and meet the expectations of our stakeholders. Over the past 20 years, the Bank has voluntarily adopted various measures to considerably improve the energy efficiency of its buildings. As a member of the Energy Savers Circle of Hydro-Quebec (a public utility that manages the transmission and distribution of electricity in Quebec), the Bank has set up an innovative web-based interface to remotely manage energy use at over 100 of its branches. This system allows the Bank to oversee its facilities and make sure they meet energy efficiency goals, year after year. The Bank also implements the criteria for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification in its buildings and aims for LEED v4 Gold certification for its new head office to be completed in 2023. Among other things, this allows the Bank to reduce its Greenhouse gas emissions despite an increase in activities. Our Greenhouse gas emissions for 2019 have been calculated at 9,732 tonnes of CO2-down 16% compared to 2017. The Bank has renewed its commitment to carbon neutrality by buying carbon credits to offset emissions that can't be eliminated. This year, the Bank has set a target to reduce its Greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2025. This science-based target aims to help limit global warming to 1.5 C, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.",1
181,"Since the Industrial Revolution, an increase in energy consumption has heightened the concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere, and global warming is progressing. If warming continues without taking any effective countermeasures, there will be major changes in the earth's climate. This will cause phenomena such as rising sea levels and abnormal weather patterns, and have a great impact on the living environments of people and other organisms. Abnormal weather patterns will also increase the risk of damage to the business activities of the Mitsui Fudosan Group.",0

132,"Climate change is a long-term risk associated with high uncertainty regarding timing, scope and severity of potential impacts. The risks for insurers can be grouped into physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks relate to losses from climate trends (i.e. changing weather patterns and sea level rise) and climate events (i.e. extreme weather and natural disasters). These physical risks impact property & casualty (P&C) insurance, but also life insurance, for instance through higher than expected mortality rates. Losses can also follow from credit risk and collateral linked to the mortgage portfolio. Aegon is exposed to mortality risk and mortgage underwriting risks and has limited exposure to P&C risk, including catastrophic risk. Beyond insured losses from physical climate damages, climate change can increase uninsured damages and losses and may have disrupting and cascading effects on the wider economy and across the financial system. The second category of risks is associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks can affect the value of assets and impact the investments portfolios of insurers. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that Aegon itself is unable to adjust to environmental and sustainability goals. The transition risks are determined by largely uncertain factors such as policy and regulatory changes, political, social and market dynamics and technological innovations. Linked to both the physical and the transition risks, there could be litigation and reputational risks following from not fully considering or responding to the impacts of climate change, or not providing appropriate disclosure of current and future risks. The risks can relate both to Aegon and the companies in which it invests.",0

This coalition comprises the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the WWF, with the aim of supporting companies interested in setting environmental targets in line with the Paris Agreement goals. As Science Based Targets Initiative - Climate Change has not yet determined a methodology for setting such targets for companies in the financial sector, BNP Paribas is participating in Science Based Targets Initiative - Climate Change working groups to help develop one; - The Group signed the Katowice Commitment in 2018, and the Collective Commitment to Climate Action signed, in September 2019, by 33 banks that are also signatories of the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) under the aegis of United Nations Environment Programme FI (United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative). The Group has thus undertaken to develop tools that can be used to align its loan book with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In 2019, BNP Paribas tested the methodology developed by the think tank '2 Degrees Investing Initiative'26. - Lastly, in December 2019, BNP Paribas signed the Poseidon Principles promoting decarbonisation of the maritime transport industry by encouraging banks to incorporate climate considerations in their portfolios and credit decisions. Their objective is to meet the goal set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce Greenhouse gas emission in maritime transport by at least 50% by 2050 (compared to 2008 levels).

679,"Lufthansa Group provides incentives for the achievement of climate- related targets on board-level. The Supervisory Board defined specific CO2 reduction as focus topic for the strategic and sustainability target for long-term variable remuneration (LTI) for the 2020 financial year. The non-financial performance criteria thus take the interests of key stakeholders into account and provide long-term incentives for the environmental goal of reducing specific carbon emissions. For the LTI, the possible range of the target achievement for the financial and non- financial targets is between 0% and 200%. For the non-financial target “Environment”, the targets set by IATA (International Air Transport Association) for fuel efficiency are used, i.e. the average amount of kerosene consumed to carry a passenger 100 kilometres. The aim is to reduce specific fuel consumption by 1.5% p.a. and so to improve specific CO2 emissions. The LTI for 2020 includes emissions from Lufthansa’s own fleet as well as those from wet lease flights. To calculate performance, the improvement in specific CO2 emissions is measured annually over the four-year performance period. This was the Further Disclosure only non-financial target for LTI in 2019 and 2020 and accounted for 25% of the LTI. Specific CO2 efficiency (including wet-lease flights) came to 10.52 kg/100 passenger-kilometres in 2020 (2019: 9.22 kg/100 passenger-kilometres), so that performance in the 2020 financial year for the environmental parameter for the LTI 2020 was 0%. The development of this KPI in 2020 was due to the corona pandemic and mainly driven by comprehensive travel restrictions which resulted in lower passenger load factor and a higher share of short-haul flights which emit relatively more CO2 than long-haul flights.",1

We’ve got to be more efficient and competitive year on year, delivering what our customers want and how they want it – not least because disrupters will enter the market and beat us if we don’t. I’m the Chair of Climatewise – the insurance industry’s body on climate change. The risks of unmitigated global warming are pretty stark, for individuals, for business and for communities. We need to do all we can to address this challenge. For insurers, a temperature increase of four degrees effectively means insurers will have to bow out. Insurers will not be able to cover the risks.

388,"The main impacts of the 4ºC scenario were: • Physical ramifications of climate change: in this scenario we expect extreme weather events of escalating severity and frequency, which could increase disruption to our assets and our customers. This would require investment to ‘harden’ assets and would heighten the safety risk to our field employees. Our approach to physical climate risk is discussed in more detail below. • Lower system visibility: as this scenario sees less coordinated policy and regulation in pursuit of decarbonisation, we would anticipate a greater variety of solutions being deployed across our networks. This could increase overall system costs and reduce visibility over the network, potentially slowing our responsiveness to disruptive events. We do note, however, that a greater number of distributed assets would increase the potential for local balancing, which could mitigate this. • Inequality of access: without carefully designed policy, we believe decarbonisation activities have the potential to leave some sectors of society behind: for example, heat pumps and the energy efficiency upgrades they typically require are currently cost-prohibitive for many. As well as the ethical implications of this, there is a risk to the Group, especially for our US businesses, that a proportion of our customers would struggle to pay their bills.",0
